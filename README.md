## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shipment-price-prediction.git
   cd shipment-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your shipment data in the `data/` directory. Ensure it follows the structure expected by the model.

2. **Run the Analysis:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` directory and follow the steps to preprocess the data and train the model.

3. **Make Predictions:**
   - Use the `model.py` script to load your trained model and make predictions based on new shipment data.

## Model Performance

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared. Refer to the Jupyter notebook for detailed performance results and visualizations.
